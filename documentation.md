## 1. Overview
RWater is a dynamic water script inspired by the gmod addon 'GWater', It's very fun to use so I think you should try it out not gonna lie!

2. After downloading, open it by dragging it to the roblox studio or just simply double clicking it. ![image](https://github.com/nelvismyname/RWater/assets/128294744/4337e55f-5850-4eb3-85a3-0cc69963137c)

That's basically it, if you wanna implement it into your game then just ctrl+c or cut them and put them into your game, simple as that.
Just make sure that they are in the same parent. (Same location)
